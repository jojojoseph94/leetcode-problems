Logic: DP -> make a paths grid
             fill top row and left row with 1s
             The number of paths to a cell is equal to sum of
             number of paths in cell just above and cell to the left

Time complexity : O(M*N)
Space complexity : O(M*N) -> Optimization process row by row and keep last row only
